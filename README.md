# sorting_analyzer

Introduction:
This is a sorting visualizer built using Python's Tkinter library, which allows users to visualize the sorting of an array using different algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort.

Expected Output:
The program generates an array of random integers and visualizes the sorting process with color changes and sounds. It supports different sorting algorithms, showing their step-by-step execution.

Requirements:
Python 3.x ,
Tkinter (for the UI) ,
ttkbootstrap (for UI styling) ,
winsound (for sound effects)

Methodology:
Array Generation: The user can either generate a random array or input their own array.
Sorting Visualization: Select a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, etc.) to see the sorting process step by step.
Speed Control: The user can adjust the speed of the visualization.
Sound Effects: Each action in the sorting algorithm triggers a sound based on the array element's value.
UI Elements: Includes a canvas to display the array and buttons to control the sorting process.



Conclusion:
This program serves as an educational tool to understand different sorting algorithms. It allows users to visually see how each algorithm works and compare their performance in sorting an array.
